## What is GSAP?

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is the industry-standard JavaScript animation library for building smooth, high-performance web animations. It gives you precise control over DOM elements, CSS properties, SVGs, and scroll-based interactions — far beyond what CSS animations can offer.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1 — Core Fundamentals
- [ ] `gsap.to()`, `gsap.from()`, `gsap.fromTo()`
- [ ] Animating position, opacity, scale, rotation
- [ ] Duration, delay, and repeat

### Phase 2 — Motion Control
- [ ] Easing (`power1`, `bounce`, `elastic`, `expo`)
- [ ] `yoyo` and `repeat` for looping
- [ ] `stagger` for sequential multi-element animations

### Phase 3 — Timeline
- [ ] `gsap.timeline()` for sequencing
- [ ] `position` parameter (`"<"`, `">"`, offsets)
- [ ] Controlling playback: `play()`, `pause()`, `reverse()`

### Phase 4 — ScrollTrigger
- [ ] Basic `ScrollTrigger` setup
- [ ] `scrub`, `pin`, `markers`
- [ ] Scroll-linked vs scroll-triggered animations

### Phase 5 — Projects
- [ ] Animated landing page hero
- [ ] Scroll-driven portfolio section
- [ ] Staggered card reveal

## Key Principles

- **Performance first** — always animate `transform` and `opacity`, not layout properties like `width` or `top`
- **Use Timelines** instead of stacking delays — they're easier to control and debug
- **ScrollTrigger** is essential for modern portfolio work; learn it after Timelines are solid
- **Consistency > complexity** — master the basics before chasing fancy effects

---

## Why GSAP?

CSS animations break down at a certain complexity. GSAP gives you:
- Precise sequencing and callbacks
- Hardware-accelerated performance
- Consistent cross-browser behavior
- A plugin ecosystem (ScrollTrigger, MorphSVG, Flip, etc.)

It's widely used in agency work, portfolios, and production sites.
